# 🌤️ Weather Dashboard Setup Guide for Beginners

A complete step-by-step guide to set up and run your own weather dashboard application.

## 📋 What You'll Build

This weather dashboard allows you to:
- Check current weather for your location or any city worldwide
- View 5-day weather forecasts with temperature trends
- See weather maps and detailed metrics (humidity, wind speed, pressure, etc.)
- Quick access to weather in popular cities

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A computer with internet connection
- Basic familiarity with using a terminal/command prompt
- About 30 minutes of time

## 📦 Step 1: Install Python

### For Windows:
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer and **check "Add to PATH"**
4. Click "Install Now"

### For Mac:
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts

### For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

### Verify Installation:
Open terminal/command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
You should see something like "Python 3.9.x"

## 🔑 Step 2: Get Your Weather API Key

1. **Visit OpenWeatherMap:**
   - Go to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api)

2. **Create Account:**
   - Click "Sign Up" 
   - Fill in your details (it's free!)
   - Verify your email

3. **Get API Key:**
   - Log in to your account
   - Go to "API Keys" section in your dashboard
   - Copy your API key (it looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0`)
   - **Save this key** - you'll need it later!

4. **Wait for Activation:**
   - New API keys take 10-15 minutes to activate
   - Have a coffee break! ☕

## 💾 Step 3: Download the Code

1. **Create a project folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir weather-dashboard
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. **Save the code:**
   - Copy the provided Python code
   - Save it as `weather_app.py` in your project folder

## 📚 Step 4: Install Required Libraries

Open terminal/command prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
pip install streamlit requests plotly pandas geopy geocoder
```

**What each library does:**
- `streamlit`: Creates the web interface
- `requests`: Fetches data from the weather API
- `plotly`: Creates interactive charts
- `pandas`: Handles data processing
- `geopy`: Converts city names to coordinates
- `geocoder`: Detects your current location

**If you get permission errors on Mac/Linux:**
```bash
pip3 install streamlit requests plotly pandas geopy geocoder
```

## 🚀 Step 5: Run the Application

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run weather_app.py
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   - The app will automatically open in your browser
   - If not, go to: `http://localhost:8501`

3. **First time setup:**
   - You'll see the weather dashboard interface
   - Enter your API key in the sidebar (the one you got from Step 2)

## 🎯 Step 6: Using the App

### Enter Your API Key:
1. Look for "🔑 API Configuration" in the left sidebar
2. Paste your OpenWeatherMap API key
3. You should see "✅ API Key configured!"

### Check Current Location Weather:
1. Select "🎯 Current Location" in the sidebar
2. Click "🔄 Get Current Location Weather"
3. The app will detect your location and show weather

### Search for Any City:
1. Select "🔍 Search City" in the sidebar
2. Type a city name (e.g., "London", "Tokyo", "New York")
3. Click "🔍 Search"

### Quick City Access:
- Scroll down to see buttons for popular cities
- Click any city button for instant weather

### Customize Display:
- In the sidebar, toggle "Show 5-day forecast"
- Toggle "Show weather map" on/off

## 🎨 Understanding the Interface

### Main Weather Display Shows:
- **Temperature** and "feels like" temperature
- **Weather icon** and description
- **Humidity, pressure, visibility**
- **Wind speed and cloud coverage**
- **Sunrise and sunset times**

### Forecast Section Shows:
- **5-day weather outlook**
- **Temperature trend chart**
- **Daily high/low temperatures**

### Weather Map Shows:

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Module not found" error:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade streamlit requests plotly pandas geopy geocoder
```

**API key not working:**
- Wait 10-15 minutes after creating the key
- Check for typos in the API key
- Make sure you're using the correct key from your OpenWeatherMap account

**Location not found:**
- Try typing the full city name with country (e.g., "London, UK")
- Check spelling

**App won't start:**
- Make sure you're in the correct folder
- Check that `weather_app.py` is in the folder
- Try: `python -m streamlit run weather_app.py`

**No internet connection errors:**
- Check your internet connection
- The app needs internet to fetch weather data
